# Effective quantum transport simulations with Kwant

Kwant is a free software library that makes quantum transport simulations simple.
In this tutorial I will give an overview of Kwant's capabilities, as well as
practical tips for using Kwant effectively and combining it with other numerical
tools. In addition we will take a look at the underlying formalism and numerical
implementation used by Kwant, in order to better avoid pitfalls in interpreting
results.
